# quiz-app-parth
This is a code for a for quiz app. It has 3 types of questions: multiple-choice, data-gathering single-choice, and data gathering multiple-choice. This was created for a Uni project I'm a beginner coder and it always bothered me that there weren't clear instructions on how to use it since everyone assumed that you will know how to run it.

For that reason, here is how I run it. It may work for you or you will have to troubleshoot. Good luck

Open the code folder in Visual Studio Code Open a terminal 
Enter: pip install flask 
Enter: pip install flask-cors 
Enter: python server.py

Then open the welcome.html file and it should start. hopefully.
